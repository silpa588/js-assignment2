
/* Difference Between var,Let and Const */

Var  and Let :var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
------>It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.

Ex:Input:
     console.log(x);
     var x=5;
     console.log(x);

   Output:
      undefined
       5
Ex:for Let

Input:
    console.log(x);
     let x=5;
       console.log(x);

Output:
Error

----> Let Variable scope is with in the BLock.

const:If we declare const before a variable it cannot be modified once it is declared.

Ex:const c = 'hello'
//Error: Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
        
        c = 'world'
